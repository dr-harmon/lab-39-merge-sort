# Lab 39: Merge Sort

In this lab, we will implement merge sort and measure its performance. The project includes:

* Implementations of bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort
* A template for implementing merge sort
* Unit tests and performance benchmarks for all of the above

To begin, examine the source code of bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort. If you don't remember how these algorithms work, use the textbook or an online resource to review them.

Next, implement merge sort in the `mergeSort` function. Make sure that the unit tests pass.

Finally, uncomment the benchmark tests in `sort_test.cpp` and run them. (Feel free to alter the sizes if necessary to match the speed of your computer.) Graph the results using a tool such as [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator). Include a screen shot or photograph of your work with the lab submission.

Do the performance measurements match the theoretical time complexities?
